This project is a personal initiative to deepen my understanding of modern development tools and practices. It focuses on gaining hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes, exploring containerization, orchestration, and deployment workflows. Through this journey, I aim to strengthen my technical skills and build a solid foundation in cloud-native technologies.
